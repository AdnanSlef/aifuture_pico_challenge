The car door firmware comes from https://github.com/mitre-cyber-academy/2023-ectf-insecure-example and is not part of my project.
(We have permission to attack this firmware.)
Rather, the entire car door (firmware, TivaWare board, related programs) are taken as pre-existant, and my Pi Pico Fob Device interacts with it.
My project is the Pi Pico portion and the attack, not creating the car door.
